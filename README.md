## Milestone 1
* Create a basic form with an input (multiline textarea) and a button which allows the user to add notes
* Every note added should have the note’s text and the note’s created date
* Display the notes in a grid-like format.

## Milestone 2
* Display the date in human readable format: Aug 31th 12:30 PM
* Add a delete button that when clicked,  prompts the user with a message “Are you sure you want to delete your note?” (you can use JavaScript's default global confirm() function). If the user hits confirm, delete the note from the list

## Milestone 3
* Add an optional note title: 
-in the form add an input for note title;
-in the note, display the title above the text;
* The user can add a note without a title (then no title will be displayed in the note), but the note’s text is mandatory.

## Milestone 3.1
* Add the ability to resize your textarea dynamically when the user types text (add/remove rows)
* Remove the manual resize handler in the bottom right corner of the textarea
